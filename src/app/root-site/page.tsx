          <Section title="The word">
            <p>
              I made the word up. Endogenous, from within, and generator. An
              endogenator is something that generates from the inside rather
              than waiting on the outside. There&apos;s an O.G. in there too,
              on purpose, the claim isn&apos;t just generating from within,
              it&apos;s that the thing generated is actually yours, made
              rather than borrowed. And it&apos;s a maker of doing, not just
              a self-starter. The word is about the process as much as the
              motivation.
            </p>
            <p>
              I first ran into endogenous growth theory in an undergrad
              economics class, buried in a production model. It answers a
              specific puzzle: growth that shows up but can&apos;t be
              explained by more labor or more capital going in. The
              unexplained remainder turns out to be people, learning,
              learning to work with others, learning collectively, the parts
              of growth that come from something other than physical input.
              That idea stuck with me long before I had any theoretical use
              for it. I&apos;ve started a few small businesses of my own, and
              I believe in community as something you build from inside it,
              not something that arrives from outside.
            </p>
            <p>
              I used to call myself an entrepreneur. At some point that word
              stopped fitting. Not because what I do changed, but because
              the word did, it started meaning quick wealth and extraction
              more than it meant building something that outlasts you. I
              needed a word that still meant what entrepreneur used to mean
              to me, growth that comes from inside a person, a business, a
              community, rather than growth that gets imported or extracted
              from somewhere else. I made one.
            </p>
            <p>
              What I actually mean is closer to Johnny Appleseed, someone
              who spent his life helping small things take root in a lot of
              different soil, seeding what makes the next step possible
              before anyone&apos;s asked for it. That&apos;s the part I
              want, making it easier for people to step into what&apos;s
              next. Not because I&apos;ll own the orchards, but because
              that&apos;s where I want humanity to live, closer to
              what&apos;s already possible than it currently stands.

            <p>
              For most of my life I&apos;ve been bothered by a gap. Not the
              ordinary gap between what people say and what they do,
              everyone has some version of that, but a deeper one: the
              space between what people profess to believe and the actions
              they actually take when it counts. It shows up everywhere
              once you start looking for it, in institutions, in close
              relationships, in myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              I&apos;ve studied a lot of different kinds of systems, and I
              could never quite land on a fix that would help other people
              close that gap too, not just me. In conversations with people
              close to me, I kept drifting toward the same uncomfortable
              place: that maybe the only real fix was something like
              starting a new religion, since nothing else seemed to organize
              belief and action at a scale large enough to make a real
              difference. It wasn&apos;t a passing thought. It came back
              more than once, over years, because nothing smaller than that
              seemed to match the size of what I was actually seeing.
            </p>
            <p>
              That impulse wasn&apos;t wrong about the scale of the problem.
              It was aimed at the wrong tool. What I needed wasn&apos;t a new
              institution to organize belief. It was a theory that explained
              why belief and action come apart in the first place, and what
              actually has to be true for them to stay together. Belief, in
              other words, that could guide believing itself.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="What I found instead">
            <p>
              The gap exists because every existing account of knowledge,
              education, and society studies the <em>output</em> of belief
              and never the thing producing it. Identity, the carrier, gets
              factored out of the picture, and only its deposits get
              studied. That omission is not a minor gap. It&apos;s the
              reason coordination at scale so often defends a position,
              draws a line, creates a barrier, instead of expanding what&apos;s
              actually possible, why institutions built to organize belief
              eventually calcify into institutions that just protect it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The name for the alternative, coordination that actually
              expands what&apos;s collectively reachable rather than just
              reproducing what already holds, is{" "}
              <strong>Generative Coordination</strong>. It&apos;s the center
              of the theoretical work I do, and it&apos;s still being built
              in real time. That&apos;s stated plainly, not as a caveat. The
              theory is a moving target on purpose, which is exactly why
              there&apos;s a reason to come back.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think Generative Coordination will hold up because it&apos;s
              true. But I don&apos;t expect that to be why anyone actually
              picks it up. People adopt an idea because of the story around
              it, the same way a best practice spreads through an industry
              long before anyone&apos;s rigorously verified it works better
              than the alternative. I&apos;m building the story on purpose,
              not instead of the truth, alongside it.
